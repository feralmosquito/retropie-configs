		<name>Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II</name>
		<desc>Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II (アイルトン・セナ スーパーモナコＧＰ II) or simply Super Monaco GP II is a racing game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear in 1992. It is a sequel to Super Monaco GP, but this time the game is sponsored by Ayrton Senna (who won the Monaco Grand Prix six times). Also unlike the previous game, Super Monaco GP II was not released in arcades or for any non-Sega console or computer.

At the time of release it was regarded as the most realistic racing experience on home video game consoles, and the fact that it was endorsed by Ayrton Senna meant the game was very popular. However, due to these celebrity endorsements, it is unlikely Super Monaco GP II will be re-released without cutbacks.</desc>

		<name>Crystal Warriors</name>
		<desc>The continent of Tyramus has lived in peace for almost a century, thanks to the four elemental crystals of the kingdom of Arliel. However, peace is threatened by the invading armies of the Jyn Empire, led by Emperor Grym, who wants to use the four crystals to rule over Tyramus. Fortunately, Princess Iris can escape with one of the crystals and now the player has to protect her and the crystal and somehow find a way to drive back the hordes of Jyn.

Gameplay in Crystal Warriors is quite similar to Shining Force. The player fights in turn-based battles controlling different characters like fighters, healers, rangers and mages, all with different strengths and skills. Whenever two units engage in battle, they enter a duel mode lasting for up to two turns. In this mode the player can choose between four commands: "battle" (attack), "retreat", "spell" and "monster". While the first three commands are quite self-explanatory, the "monster" command is interesting. Whenever a non-human enemy is defeated, it can be tamed and be used in battles. While most monsters do not have many HP they can serve as good attackers for physically weak characters or take some hits in order to protect his master. In-between battles the player can visit towns to rest, buy weapons and spells or recruit new party members.</desc>

Players have to use two paddles; the upper one is used to defeat demons while the lower one helps to prevent the player from dropping to its demise at the bottom of the board. By defeating bad guys and smashing through breakable blocks, the player advances towards the boss of each level.
Resembling a harder version of Arkanoid, the vertically scrolling screen forces the ball to move constantly forward in an attempt to reach the boss.
Only the Sega Mega Drive version has a two-player option. Players can choose between three difficulty levels in the Game Gear version and can also select an option to do a time trial.</desc>

		<name>Jurassic Park</name>
		<desc>One of many games based on the 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park, the version for Sega's 8-bit systems combines side-scrolling shooting action and platforming levels.

In each of the five stages of the game, one escaped dinosaur species must be recaptured. Each level begins with a side-scrolling driving section. Dinosaurs attack the car and must be fend off by firing at them with a crosshair. If the player survives long enough, a boss battle against an especially powerful dinosaur follows.

After the completion of the driving section the level continues with a platform section. The player must jump, duck and climb to survive moving lifts, floors that will crumble under his feet, environmental hazards like acid drops, steam leaks or giant boulders and more. Dinosaurs will of course also stand in the way, but can be defeated by using several weapons: a rifle, a grenade launcher and hand grenades. Navigating the often maze-like levels will lead to the dinosaur that must be captured and a corresponding boss fight.

The first four levels (featuring a Velociraptor, Pteranodon, Triceratops and Brachiosaurus) can be tackled in any order, but the final level, featuring the Tyrannosaurus Rex, is only unlocked when the others have been completed.</desc>

		<name>Lunar: Sanposuru Gakuen</name>
		<desc>This is a side-story, set in the same world as the famous Lunar RPGs: Silver Star and Eternal Blue. The town of Burg is populated by harvesters, and you take control of two girls, Ellie and Lena. One day, they are sent to the island of Ien where they should study magic, and there begins their adventure.

The game is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. You navigate your party through a top-down world, visiting towns and hostile areas. Enemy encounters are random, the battles are turn-based and are viewed from first-person perspective.

Whilst not officially released in English, there is now a completed fan-translation of this game.</desc>

Game description:

 "All is not well for Bruno, the baby Ottifant. A father captured by Aliens! Or so our Otti-infant imagines as he follows the trail of sweets that will lead him to his abducted parent. It's a trail of peril and adventure--- terrifying toys, a blood-chilling basement and an office of hi-tech horror."</desc>

		<desc>Ristar, known as Ristar the Shooting Star (リスター・ザ・シューティングスター Risutā za Shūtingu Sutā?) in Japan, is a platform video game released by Sega in 1995 for the Sega Game Gear. While sharing themes and gameplay elements from its main counterpart, Ristar, for the Sega Genesis, it is a largely different game. The game was well received by critics, who felt the gameplay mechanics were transferred over well to the older, aging Game Gear system, but were divided on whether or not the game was worth playing if both versions of the game were available to the consumer. The game received even less exposure than its Genesis counterpart, due to the Game Gear being towards the end of its lifecycle, and having less of a userbase to begin with in comparison to the Genesis.</desc>

		<path>./Road Rash.GG</path>
		<name>Road Rash</name>
		<desc>Road Rash is the name of a motorcycle-racing video game series by Electronic Arts in which the player participates in violent, illegal street races. The series started on the Mega Drive and made its way to various other systems over the years. The game's title is based on the slang term for the severe friction burns that can occur in a motorcycle fall where skin comes into contact with the ground at high speed.

In an attempt to improve on the basic Hang-On concept, where the player's vehicle remains on the same horizontal plane and turns are essentially a matter of moving left or right, Road Rash requires that players contend with various grade changes. The physics reflect the act of going up or down a hill, as well as turning while climbing; this results in the ability to launch one's motorcycle great distances, resulting in crashes (and their animations). Aside from this, Road Rash has a standard system of obstacles including street signs, trees, poles, and livestock; and taking from OutRun, active traffic while racing against other bikers.

What Road Rash really brings to the table is "brawling"; the player can fight other bikers with a variety of hand weapons or simple punches and kicks. The player initially starts off with just those basics, but can grab a weapon from another rider by timing a punch correctly. The list of weapons has grown with the games, starting from the clubs in the first Road Rash, and eventually including things like crowbars, nunchaku, and cattle prods. Whatever the weapon, successful attacks damage an opponent's stamina, and depleting this stamina will cause a biker to wipeout which can also damage the bike; this functions much like hitting a car or other major obstacle, and it all applies to you as much as to other racers (though in most of the games, you have more stamina than opponents).

As mentioned before, the last and most major obstacle are cops. The motorcycle police officers fight the player as another opponent and serve as gameplay enforcers by culling players who fall too far behind or choose to explore the world rather than race in it. Losing a fight with an officer or being caught by one while off one's motorcycle causes the player to be Busted, ending the race.</desc>

Dr. Robotnik has stolen the Red Chaos Emerald, causing the other five to "lose balance" and scatter themselves into a parallel universe. As a result of the instability, South Island is now sinking into the ocean. It is up to Sonic and Tails to find the Chaos Emeralds and restore harmony to the universe, or else the innocent residents of South Island will find themselves taking a long swim.</desc>

		<name>Super Star Wars: Return of the Jedi</name>
		<desc>Star Wars: Super Return of the Jedi offers a good variety of action for a Game Gear game, with power-ups and continue points located throughout the game. Choosing from five playable characters and two vehicles keeps the game fresh, while simple controls (one for attacking, the other for jumping) make it a game anyone can get into.

The graphics look very good for the Game Gear, with solid representations of our favorite characters from the Star Wars saga. Luke looks especially nice, complete with glowing lightsaber. Though the sound is not great, it gets the job done. Unfortunately, the fantastic Star Wars theme music just doesn't sound great.

The ability to choose your characters greatly enhances the replay value, and the levels are long enough to keep most gamers busy for quite some time. Some are very difficult and require a lot of patience while performing precise jumping.</desc>

		<name>Tengen World Cup Soccer</name>
		<desc>The game has an unusual naming scheme. In Japan there were no issues, as the game was published by SIMS themselves. In North America and PAL regions however, publishing rights were given to Tengen, who altered many of the in-game banners and renamed the game Tengen World Cup Soccer, even though the majority of the work was done by SIMS.

The game offers 24 different national teams from across the world, although the choices aren't based on any official tournament from the era. For 1993 the list is quite out of date; the Federal Republic of Germany (more commonly known as West Germany) had not existed since 1990 after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Russia is represented with the flag of the Soviet Union which dissolved in late 1991, and Yugoslavia had ceased to exist by mid-1992.</desc>

		<desc>Yogi Bear has to save Jellystone National Park from an evil ghost named Jake; who stole the funds needed to keep the park operating. There are six different stages in the game that range from a large city to the Wild West. There are no-powerups in the traditional sense; players must collect 100 picnic baskets for an extra life.  Hidden doors and areas must be found in order to crack open the safes.  Once inside a safe, Yogi must collect 25 gold coins to make a bar.  In order to unlock the best ending, Yogi needs to convert 300 gold coins into 12 gold bars that will provide the park with the money to continue operations.

The player has the ability to jump on most enemies to kill them, just like in Super Mario Bros..Some enemies must be left alone due to the lack of ability to wield a weapon.  Falling down into bottomless pits or navigating into dangerous hazards will cause Yogi to lose a life.  By default, the player gets three lives and one additional continue.</desc>
